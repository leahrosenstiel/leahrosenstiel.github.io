on Federal Spending</h3> <h4 style="color:#888"> with Ben Hammond </h4> <p> <a href = "Challenges_in_Measuring_the_Impact_of_Political_Actors_on_Federal_Spending.pdf">[latest version]</a> <a href="appendix_challenges_in_measuring.pdf"> [appendix]</a> <br> When estimating the political determinants of the federal budget, a standard assumption in political science scholarship is that measures of spending can be used as a proxy for the funding decisions made by Congress. We examine the consequences of this assumption. In particular, we argue that spending data induce measurement error, which increases the likelihood of a null result and may produce biased estimates. We compare the spending data used in a recent study (Berry and Fowler 2016) with an original data set of military construction appropriations, which further allow us to disentangle congressional and presidential influences over the budget. While an analysis of the spending data produces a null result, the same analysis using the appropriations data provides strong evidence that House and Senate legislators use their committee positions to distribute pork. Our findings have broad implications for studies that use measures of spending in the congressional and presidency literatures. </p>
