  <div class="column right"> <p> Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Vanderbilt University. I study political institutions and public policy, with a focus on the U.S. Congress and American federalism. A central interest of my work is understanding how politics affects the distribution of federal funding and the design of government assistance programs.<br> <br>My main project is a book tentatively titled <i>Politics by Formula: How Congressional Policymaking Creates Disparities</i> (under contract with the Chicago Studies in American Politics series at the University of Chicago Press). While government programs may be intended to improve education or provide healthcare, I show that members of Congress treat them as opportunities to procure more funding for their constituents. Who wins and who loses out? I demonstrate that the answer is rooted in both the structure of Congress and the nature of our federal system. <br> <br>I received a Joint Ph.D. in Politics and Social Policy from Princeton University in 2021 and a B.A. in Political Science from Carleton College in 2014. Prior to beginning my graduate studies, I worked as a research assistant on K-12 education policy at the Congressional Research Service.</p> </div>
