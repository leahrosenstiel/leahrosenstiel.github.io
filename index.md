  <div class="column right"> <p> Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Politics</a> and <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/graduate-programs/programs-and-certificates/joint-degree-program-social-policy">Social Policy</a> at Princeton University and am affiliated with the <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Center for the Study of Democratic Politics</a>. I study American political institutions, with a focus on Congress and public policy. My research examines how political considerations and institutional rules shape, and at times distort, policy. In my dissertation, I examine how congressional bargaining influences federal grant programs. I show how certain aspects of the bargaining process lead to program inefficiencies such as distributing funding to areas with low need. Prior to beginning my graduate studies, I worked as a research assistant on K-12 education policy at the Congressional Research Service. I received a B.A. in Political Science from Carleton College in 2014.<br> <br>
