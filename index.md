I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Politics</a> and <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/graduate-programs/programs-and-certificates/joint-degree-program-social-policy">Social Policy</a> at Princeton University and am affiliated with the <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Center for the Study of Democratic Politics</a>. I study American political institutions, with a focus on Congress.  In my dissertation I examine how congressional structure shapes, and potentially distorts, policy. I received a B.A. in Political Science from Carleton College in 2014. Prior to beginning my graduate studies I worked as a research assistant on K-12 education policy at the Congressional Research Service.

The most recent version of my CV is available <a href="https://leahrosenstiel.github.io/Rosenstiel_Current_CV.pdf">here</a>.
