I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Politics</a> and <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/graduate-programs/programs-and-certificates/joint-degree-program-social-policy">Social Policy</a> at Princeton University and am affiliated with <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics</a>. My research examines American political institutions, with a focus on Congress. I received a B.A. in Political Science from Carleton College in 2014. Prior to beginning my graduate studies I worked as a research assistant on K-12 education policy at the Congressional Research Service.
